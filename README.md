### **Title:**  
Fine-Tuning Mistral 7B Using QLoRA 

---

### **1. Purpose**

To provide users with a streamlined, cost-effective method for fine-tuning the Mistral 7B language model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). This process leverages quantization and LoRA techniques to optimize computational resources while enhancing model performance on specific datasets.

### **2. Background**

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral 7B offer robust capabilities out-of-the-box. However, fine-tuning these models on specific datasets can significantly improve their performance on targeted tasks. QLoRA combines quantization with LoRA to make fine-tuning more resource-efficient, enabling users with limited computational power to customize LLMs effectively.

### **3. Objectives**

- **Primary Objective:** Enable users to fine-tune the Mistral 7B model using their own datasets with minimal computational resources.
- **Secondary Objectives:**
  - Reduce training costs through efficient resource utilization.
  - Maintain or improve model performance on specific tasks post fine-tuning.
  - Provide comprehensive guidance to handle common issues (e.g., OutOfMemory errors).

### **4. Scope**

- **In-Scope:**
  - Fine-tuning Mistral 7B using QLoRA.
  - Utilizing Hugging Faceâ€™s PEFT library and related tools.
  - Implementing 4-bit quantization with `bitsandbytes`.
  - Integrating Weights & Biases for training metrics tracking.
  - Ensuring compatibility with GPU environments (e.g., Brev.dev instances).

- **Out-of-Scope:**
  - Fine-tuning models other than Mistral 7B.
  - Support for non-GPU environments.
  - Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
