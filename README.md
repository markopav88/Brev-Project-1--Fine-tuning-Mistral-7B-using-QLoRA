### **Title:**  
Fine-Tuning Mistral 7B Using QLoRA & also personal data(notebooks, journals, personal memos, etc)

---

### **1. Purpose**

To provide users with a streamlined, cost-effective method for fine-tuning the Mistral 7B language model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). This process leverages quantization and LoRA techniques to optimize computational resources while enhancing model performance on specific datasets. Here this was done using NVIDIAS BREV platform to aggregate the GPU power needed to train and fine tune Mistral 7B on personal data. BREV is used to find, provision, and configure artificial intelligence-ready cloud instances for development, training, and deployment.

### **2. Background**

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral 7B offer robust capabilities out-of-the-box. However, fine-tuning these models on specific datasets can significantly improve their performance on targeted tasks. QLoRA combines quantization with LoRA to make fine-tuning more resource-efficient, enabling users with limited computational power to customize LLMs effectively.

### **3. Objectives**

- **Primary Objective:** Enable users to fine-tune the Mistral 7B model using their own datasets with minimal computational resources.
- **Secondary Objectives:**
  - Reduce training costs through efficient resource utilization.
  - Maintain or improve model performance on specific tasks post fine-tuning.
  - Provide comprehensive guidance to handle common issues (e.g., OutOfMemory errors).

## Context
# In the example in which I used my own personal data from my exported notes(not published). This is a example of a "Single Long String".
### Single Long Strings vs. Input-Output Pairs

### Single Long Strings

**Definition:**  
Each training example is a continuous sequence of text without explicit separation between inputs and outputs. Essentially, the model learns from raw text data, predicting the next word or token in the sequence.

**Example:**  
A novel, article, or any extended piece of text where the model reads through the entire content as one uninterrupted stream.

### Input-Output Pairs

**Definition:**  
Each training example consists of a distinct input and a corresponding desired output. This structure is common in tasks like question-answering, translation, or any application where a specific response is expected based on a given prompt.

**Example:**

- **Input:**  
  "Translate the following sentence to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"

- **Output:**  
  "Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?"
